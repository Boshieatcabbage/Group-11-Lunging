# Agression Lunging Simulation

Please copy the preprogrammed.py and fly.py to update the class definition and restart the kernel to make sure the program runs correctly.
Please run the flies.py class definition to enable the simulation of the overall performance

- Lunging behavior simulation manipulation data

- Multi-camera rendering of one-fly simulation

- Multi-fly simulation

- Force measurement plot

- Plot of the simulation result



Running the first four code blocks would be able to provide the basic setup for the lunging behavior 
The 5th block would act like a sanity check to verify the actuation angle
The Multi-Camera rendering and Multi-fly simulation could be run to produce videos of lunging.
All the above code could be run simultaneously.

The Rendering block and the Peak Force measurement block could not be implemented in one run. 

- In order to perform peak force measurement, please restart the kernel, uncomment the measurement block, and comment out the rendering blocks
    
- To switch back to rendering, undo the above process.

    
The last two blocks are plots of measurement data from manipulation of Peak force measurement.
